                <p>Dublin's General Post Office is situated prominently in the middle of O'Connell Street. It is the
                    headquarters for An Post, the Irish Postal Service, and the foundation stone was laid in 1814. It is
                    well known as the stronghold of the 1916 Rising against British Rule.</p>
                <p>
                    The GPO was important as the main stronghold of the Irish Volunteers in the 1916 Rising. The Witness
                    History Museum is an excellent way to learn about the Rising. You can still see round bullet holes
                    in
                    the large columns outside. Since the building was destroyed except for the front portico and facade,
                    it
                    was rebuilt and reopened in 1929. It retained elements of the original design while introducing some
                    attractive art deco features. The GPO is often a place of remembrance, protests and pageantry.</p>

                <p>For over 100 years Kilmainham Gaol held thousands of men, women and children for crimes that ranged

                <p>
                    Kilmainham Gaol opened in 1796 as the new County Gaol for Dublin. While most of the prisoners were
                    common criminals, it also held political prisoners involved in Ireland’s struggle for independence.
                    Included amongst those held here were Robert Emmet, Anne Devlin, the Fenians, Charles Stewart
                    Parnell, Countess Markievicz and the leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising, 14 of whom were executed by
                    firing squad in the Stonebreaker’s yard. The Gaol was closed in 1924 but was preserved as a national
                    monument in the 1960s</p>

                <p> Just a short walk from Trinity College, on the way to Christchurch, Dublin Castle is well situated
                    for visiting on foot. The history of this city-centre site stretches back to the Viking Age and the
                    castle itself was built in the thirteenth century. The building served as a military fortress, a
                    prison, a treasury and courts of law. For 700 years, from 1204 until independence, it was the seat
                    of English (and then British) rule in Ireland. Rebuilt as the castle we now know in the seventeenth,
                    eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Dublin Castle is now a government complex and an
                    arena of state ceremony. The state apartments, undercroft, chapel royal, heritage centre and
                    restaurant are now open to visitors.</p>

                <p>Built between 1220 and 1260 in honour of Ireland’s patron saint, Saint Patrick’s Cathedral offers
                    visitors a rich and compelling cultural experience and is one of the few buildings left from
                    medieval Dublin. St Patrick baptised Christian converts on this site 1500 years ago. It is the
                    National Cathedral of the Church of Ireland and the largest cathedral in the country. Jonathan
                    Swift, author of Gulliver’s Travels, was dean of Saint Patrick’s Cathedral in the 1700s and he is
                    one of many burials on site. The cathedral is world famous for its choir, established in 1432, which
                    still performs daily during school term.</p>
